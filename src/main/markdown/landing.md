How should the disappearance and re-emergence of food supply as a security problem in Swedish security
politics be understood? Recent crises such as the pandemic, the Ukraine War and climate change have put food
security back on the agenda after having been abandoned as part of defence policies in the 1990's. This project
analyses how the issue of food supply has been framed by different political actors, and explains the process
whereby it becomes excluded or included on the security agenda. Through a historical-comparative study this
study asks when, by whom, and how, issues of food security have been securitized and de-securitized in Swedish
politics. Using novel methods for analysing large corpora of text material, we study food security in the Swedish
Riksdag from the early 1900’s until 2025, and two in depth studies of the period of de-securitization in the 90's
and the recent period of re-emergence of food as a security problem in Swedish politics. Empirically, the project
provides new details to the assumption of the 1990’s as a period of de-securitization, and new empirical and
theoretical understanding of the conditions under which de- and re-securitization takes place. The project
advances the study of de-securitization, which is largely neglected in previous research on securitization.
