  abstract = {The Swedish parliamentary records are an important source material for social science and humanities researchers. We introduce a new research corpus, the Swedish Parliament Corpus, which is larger and more developed than previously available research corpora for the Swedish parliament. The corpus contains annotated and structured parliamentary records over more than 150 years, through the bicameral parliament (1867{--}1970) and the unicameral parliament (1971{--}). In addition to the records, which contain all speeches in the parliament, we also provide a database of all members of parliament over the same period. Along with the corpus, we describe procedures to ensure data quality. The corpus facilitates detailed analysis of parliamentary speeches in several research fields.},

  ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the distributions of word classes in English speeches made in the Europea
  n Parliament and their German (written) translations and simultaneous interpretations. For comparison, a samp
  le of original German speeches and a selection of political interviews are used. The study is motivated by th
  e intention to understand the relationship between the type of mediation and communicative modes: mediated sp
  oken language is compared to unmediated spoken language and to mediated written language. The results show th
  at the interpretations exhibit a less nominal style than the translations, in this respect resembling unplann
  ed spoken conversation. Other quantitative findings, such as a high frequency of adverbs, also point to a reg
  ister effect, but interpretations have a hybrid status and can be located somewhere in the middle, between th
  e register of the source text (parliamentary speech) and unplanned spoken discourse. The results are discusse
  d against the background of the mechanisms that presumably underlie the choices made by translators (processi
  ng, register and strategies).},
