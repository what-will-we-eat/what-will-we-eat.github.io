    abstract = {Recent international events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have put food security back on the agenda and highlighted the vulnerabilities of a global industrialized food system. In Sweden, this development stands in sharp contrast to the de-securitization of food policy that followed the ‘end of history’ at the end of the Cold War, which saw decades of emphasis on food as an integral part of preparedness replaced with food policies that emphasised international competitiveness in food production. This paper asks how food becomes part of and/or disappears from the security policy agenda and what framings that contribute to this development. Using Swedish parliamentary data covering the last 100 years, the development of food as a security issue in the Swedish national context is analysed, capturing periods of both securitization and de-securitization of food. By understanding more about how food security has been part of defence and preparedness policy debates historically, we contribute to a better understanding of the conditions affecting the current state of food security and preparedness policy in Sweden, which hopefully can inform the broader understanding of this issue in the Nordic countries.}
